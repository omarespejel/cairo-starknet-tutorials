# **Programming on Ethereum's L2: Cairo Basics pt. 2**

Before starting, I recommend that you prepare your setup to program in Cairo ❤️ with the [past tutorial](cairo_basics_1.md).

🚀 The future of Ethereum is today and it's already here. Let's learn how to use an ecosystem that:

- It supports dYdX, DeFi that has already made four hundred billion trades and represents about a quarter of all transactions made in ethereum. They have only been around for 18 months and consistently beat Coinbase in trade volume. They reduced the price of transactions from 500 to 1,000 times. They are so cheap that they don't need to charge users for gas 💸.
- From the week of March 7 to 13, 2022, for the first time, it managed to have 33% more transactions than Ethereum 💣.

And it's just the beginning. Say hi on the StarkNet [Discord](https://discord.gg/uJ9HZTUk2Y).

## 1. Add two numbers

To learn the basics of Cairo we will create together a function to add two numbers 🎓. The code is very simple but it will help us to better understand many concepts of Cairo. We will rely heavily on the [Cairo documentation](https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/). The documentation is excellent as of today it is not ready to serve as a structured tutorial for beginners. Here we seek to solve this 🦙.

Here is our code to add two numbers. You can paste it directly into your code editor or IDE. In my case I am using VSCode with the Cairo extension.

Don't worry if you don't understand everything that's going on at this point. But [@espejelomar](https://twitter.com/espejelomar) will be worried if by the end of the tutorial you don't understand every line of this code. Let me know if so because we will improve 🧐. Cairo is a low-level language so it will be more difficult than learning Python, for example. But it will be worth it 🥅. Eyes on the goal.

Let's see line by line and with additional examples what we are doing.

```python
%builtins output

from starkware.cairo.common.serialize import serialize_word

func suma_dos_nums(num1: felt, num2: felt) -> (sum):
    alloc_locals
    local sum = num1+num2
    return(sum)
end

func main{output_ptr: felt*}():
    alloc_locals
    
    const NUM1 = 1
    const NUM2 = 10

    let (sum) = suma_dos_nums(num1 = NUM1, num2 = NUM2)
    serialize_word(sum)
    return ()
end
```

## ****2. Builtins****

At the beginning of our program in Cairo we write `%builtins output`. Here we are telling the Cairo compiler that we will use the `builtin` called `output`. The builtin definition is quite technical and out of the scope of this first tutorial ([here it is](https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/how_cairo_works/builtins.html#builtins) in the documentation). For now, it suffices for us to point out that we can summon Cairo's special abilities through the builtins. If you know C++ surely you already found the similarities.

> The `output` `builtin` is what allows the program to communicate with the external world. You can think of it as the equivalent of Python’s print() or C++’s std::cout.  (Cairo [documentation](https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/hello_cairo/intro.html#writing-a-main-function)).
>

The interaction between the `builtin` `output` and the `serialize_word` function, which we imported earlier, will allow us to print to the console. In this case with `serialize_word(sum)`. Don't worry, we'll take a closer look at it later.

## 3. Importing

Cairo is built on top of Python so importing functions and variables is exactly the same. The from `starkware.cairo.common.serialize import serialize_word line` is importing the `serialize_word` function found in `starkware.cairo.common.serialize`. To see the source code of this function, just go to the `cairo-lang` Github repository ([link](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang)). For example, the serialize function is located [here](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/blob/master/src/starkware/cairo/common/serialize.cairo) inside the repository. This will be useful for finding bugs in the code or understanding Cairo more thoroughly.

> Multiple functions from the same library can be separated by commas. Functions from different libraries are imported on different lines. Cairo looks for each module in a default directory path and any additional paths specified at compile time (Cairo [documentation)](https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/reference/syntax.html#library-imports).
> 

This is how multiple functions are imported from the same library: `from starkware.cairo.common.math import (assert_not_zero, assert_not_equal)`.

## **4. The field elements (felt)**

In Cairo, when the type of a variable or argument is not specified, it is automatically assigned the type `felt`. The [Cairo documentation](https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/hello_cairo/intro.html#the-primitive-type-field-element-felt) goes into technical detail about what a `felt` is. For the purposes of this tutorial, suffice it to say that a `felt` works as an integer. In the divisions we can notice the difference between the `felt` and the integers. However, quoting the documentation:

> In most of your code (unless you intend to write very algebraic code), you won't have to deal with the fact that the values in Cairo are felts and you can treat them as if they were normal integers.
> 

## 5. The structs (the Cairo dictionaries?)

In addition to the `felt`, we have other structures at our disposal (more details in the [documentation](https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/reference/syntax.html#type-system)).

We can create our own structure, Python dictionary style:

```python
struct MyStruct:
    member first_member : felt
    member second_miember : felt
end
```

So we define a new data type called `MyStruct` with properties `first_member` and `second_member`. We defined the type of both properties to be `felt` but we could just as well have put in other types. When we create a `struct` it is mandatory to add the type.

We can create a variable of type `MyStruct`: `Name = (first_member=1, second_member=4)`. Now the `Name` variable `has` type `MyStruct`.

With `Name.first_member` we can access the value of this argument, in this case it is 1.

## 6. Tuples

Tuples in Cairo are pretty much the same as tuples in Python:

> A tuple is a finite, ordered, unalterable list of elements. It is represented as a comma-separated list of elements enclosed in parentheses (for example, `(3, x)`). Its elements can be of any combination of valid types. A tuple containing only one element must be defined in one of two ways: the element is a named tuple or it has a trailing comma. When passing a tuple as an argument, the type of each element can be specified per element (for example, `my_tuple : (felt, felt, MyStruct)`). Tuple values can be accessed with a zero-based index in parentheses `[index]`, including access to nested tuple elements as shown below (Cairo [documentation](https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/reference/syntax.html#tuples)).
> 

The Cairo documentation is very clear in its definition of tuples. Here your example:

```python
# A tuple with three elements
local tuple0 : (felt, felt, felt) = (7, 9, 13)
local tuple1 : (felt) = (5,)  # (5) is not a valid tuple.

# A named tuple does not require a trailing comma
local tuple2 : (a : felt) = (a=5)

# Tuple that contains another tuple.
local tuple3 : (felt, (felt, felt, felt), felt) = (1, tuple0, 5)
local tuple4 : ((felt, (felt, felt, felt), felt), felt, felt) = (
    tuple3, 2, 11)
let a = tuple0[2]  # let a = 13.
let b = tuple4[0][1][2]  # let b = 13.
```

## 7. The structure of functions and comments

The definition of a function in Cairo has the following format:

```python
func función(arg1: felt, arg2) -> (returned):
  # function body 
  return(returned)
end
```

- **Define the scope of the function.** We start the function with `func` and end it with `end`. This defines the scope of our function called `function`.
- **Arguments and names**. We define the arguments that the function receives in parentheses next to the name that we define for our function, `function` in this case. The arguments can carry their type defined or not. In this case `arg1` must be of type felt and `arg2` can be of any type.
- **Return**. We necessarily have to add `return()`. Although the function is not returning something. In this case we are returning a variable called `returned` so we put `return(returned)`. Even if we didn't return anything we would have to add `return()`.
- **Comments**. In Cairo we comment with `#`. This code will not be interpreted when running our program.

As with other programming languages. We will need a `main()` function that orchestrates the use of our program in Cairo. It is defined exactly the same as a normal function only with the name `main()`. It can come before or after the other functions we create in our program.

## 8. Interacting with pointers: pt. 1

> A pointer is used to indicate the address of the first `felt` of an element in memory. The pointer can be used to access the element efficiently. For example, a function can accept a pointer as an argument and then access the element at the pointer's address (Cairo [documentation](https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/reference/syntax.html#pointers)).
> 

Suppose we have a variable named `var`:

- `var*` is a pointer to the memory address of the `var` object.
- `[var]` is the value stored at address `var*`.
- `&var` is the address to the `var` object.
- `&[x]` is `x`. Can you see that x is an address?

## 9. Implicit arguments

Before explaining how implicit arguments work, a rule of thumb: If a function `foo()` calls a function with an implicit argument, `foo()` must also get and return the same implicit argument.

With that said, let's see what a function with an implicit argument looks like. The function is `serialize_word` which is available in the `starkware.cairo.common.serialize` library and we use it in our initial function to add two numbers together.

```python
%builtins output

func serialize_word{output_ptr : felt*}(word : felt):
    assert [output_ptr] = word
    let output_ptr = output_ptr + 1
    # The new value of output_ptr is implicitly
    # added in return.
    return ()
end
```

This will be a bit confusing, be prepared. I will try to make everything very clear 🤗. For a function to receive implicit arguments, we place the argument between `{}`. In this and many other cases, `output_ptr` is received, which is a pointer to a type felt. When we declare that a function receives an implicit argument, the function will automatically return the value of the implicit argument on termination of the function. If we didn't move the value of the implicit argument then it would automatically return the same value it started with. However, if during the function the value of the implicit argument is altered then the new value will be automatically returned.

In the example with the `serialize_word` function we define that we are going to receive an implicit argument called `output_ptr`. In addition, we also receive an explicit argument called `value`. At the end of the function we will return the value that `output_ptr` has at that moment. During the function we see that `output_ptr` increases by 1: `let output_ptr = output_ptr + 1`. Then the function will implicitly return the new value of `output_ptr`.

Following the rule defined at the beginning, any function that calls `serialize_word` will also have to receive the implicit `output_ptr` argument. For example, part of our function to add two numbers goes like this:

```python
func main{output_ptr: felt*}():
    alloc_locals
    
    const NUM1 = 1
    const NUM2 = 10

    let (sum) = sum_two_numbers(num1 = NUM1, num2 = NUM2)
    serialize_word(word=sum)
    return ()
end
```

We see that we call `serialize_word` so we necessarily have to also ask for the implicit argument `output_ptr` in our `main` function. This is where another property of implicit arguments comes into play, and perhaps why they are called that. We see that when calling `serialize_word` we only pass the explicit word argument. The implicit argument `output_ptr` is automatically passed 🤯! Be careful, we could also have made the implicit argument explicit like this: `serialize_word{output_ptr=output_ptr}(word=a)`. Do we already know how to program in Cairo? 🙉

So the implicit argument is implicit because:

1. Inside the implicit function, the final value of the implicit argument is automatically returned.
2. When the implicit function is called, we do not need to indicate that we are going to pass the implicit argument. The default value is automatically included.

## 10. Locals

We are almost ready to understand 100% what we did in our function that adds two numbers. I know, it's been a rocky road 🙉. But there is a rainbow at the end of the tutorial 🌈.

Thus we define a local variable: `local a = 3`.

> Any function that uses a local variable must have an `alloc_locals` declaration, usually at the beginning of the function. This statement is responsible for allocating memory cells used by local variables within the scope of the function (Cairo [documentation](https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/reference/syntax.html#locals)).
> 

As an example, look at this part of our function that adds two numbers:

```python
func sum_two_numbers(num1: felt, num2: felt) -> (sum):
    alloc_locals
    local sum = num1+num2
    return(sum)
end
```

It's very simple 💛.

Since we don't want it to be so easy, let's talk from memory. Cairo stores the local variables relative to the frame pointer (`fp`) (we'll go into more detail about the `fp` in a later tutorial). So if we needed the address of a local variable, `&sum` would not suffice as it would give us this error: `using the value fp directly requires defining a variable __fp__`. We can get this value by importing `from starkware.cairo.common.registers import get_fp_and_pc`. `get_fp_and_pc` returns a tuple with the current values of `fp` and `pc`. In the most Python style, we will indicate that we are only interested in the value of `fp` and that we will store it in a variable **`fp**: let (**fp**, _) = get_fp_and_pc()`. Done now we could use `&sum`. In another tutorial we will see an example of this.

## 11. Constants

Very simple. Just remember that they must give an integer (a field) when we compile our code. Create a constant:

```python
const NUM1 = 1
```

## ****12. References****

This is the format to define one:

```python
let ref_name : ref_type = ref_expr
```

Where `ref_type` is a type and `ref_expr` is a Cairo expression. Placing the `ref_type` is optional but it is recommended to do so.

A reference can be reassigned (Cairo [documentation](https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/reference/syntax.html#references)):

```python
let a = 7  # a is initially bound to expression 7.
let a = 8  # a is now bound to expression 8.
```

In our addition of two numbers we create a reference called `sum`. We see that we assign to `sum` the `felt` that the function `sum_two_nums` returns.

```python
let (sum) = suma_two_nums(num1 = NUM1, num2 = NUM2)
```

## 13. Conclusion

Congratulations 🚀. We have learned the basics of 🏖 Cairo. With this knowledge you could identify what is done in each line of our function that adds two integers .

In the following tutorials we will learn more about pointers and memory management; the cairo common library; how the Cairo compiler works; and more!
